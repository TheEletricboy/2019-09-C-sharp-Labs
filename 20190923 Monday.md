##Monday

Background terms:

#CPU: Central Processing Unit. Multi-core = multiple cpus joined together
		One CPU: process information in 'threads'
		Multi-Core: can ignore this as a developer and let TASKS handle this in the background


#Process: an exe or dll file. Actually the dll files tend to be dormant 'libraries' of code which get used or 'referenced'.
			 so actually on your computer it's the .exe which are executables which run your applicaitons. They can 'reference' dll libraries but it's the exe which shows up
			 as a running process

			 TO VIEW THEM: powershell: tasklist
			 			   			   get-process *nameofapp*
			 			   			   taskkill -pid (process ID it gives you)



#Thread: set of instructions sent in a batch to cpu for processing


#Application: runs with user request after user logon


#Service: runs with system request after system boot: can be ok to run wether or not a user is present

# C# 
	
	Threads: detailed developer tool to have very fine control over background threads created (but its a lot of work)

	Tasks: wrapper over threads. Abstract the programmer away from the hard work of creating and managing threads

#Tasks:
	
	Tasks are background processes. As a developer we hand over the running of each task completely to the OS Windoes. We have no control over which tasks runs when.
