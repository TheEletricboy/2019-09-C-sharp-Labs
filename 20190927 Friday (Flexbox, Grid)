#Web Layout

#HTML Layout

	Traditional websites used HTML for layout

	<div class="navbar"><!--menu --></div>
	<div class="main"><!--main content --></div>
	<div class="footer"></div>

#HTML 5 Layout:
	
	Semantic tag: same as DIV (division of a page) but 
	just has meaning related to placing and content on page

		HEADER
		NAV 		(navigation bar ie: menu items)
		SECTION
				ARTICLE
				ASIDE
		FOOTER

Assistive technologies oten pay attention to these tags:
	
	eg: screen readers
	eg: <img alt="" title="" />
			 alt displayed on hover and also read out by screen reader


#CSS:
 	
 	<button class="buttonTypeROund" />

 	<style>
 	.buttonTypeRound{
 		border-radius:5px;
 	}


#Flexbox:
	
	Useful for 1D arrangement of items, eg: Nav bar or a Picture Gallery (easy to center etc etc)

#Grid

	Set a varying column widths to fixed/auto/match content etc
	Good for laying out responsive layout and placing elements with minimum 
	of fuss. Good for centering items easily within page or grid box.
