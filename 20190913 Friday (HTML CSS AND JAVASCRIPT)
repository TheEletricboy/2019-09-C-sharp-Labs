## HTML CSS and Javascript

# Modern Web

Lets begin the day with a little "chekc the end from the beginning"

Web is so exciting there is lots to explore

HTML <html><p>this is a paragraph</html>

	<tag> 
	<img src= "html......" width="200" height="200" />	src is called an attribute the tag

	HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language ==> Skeleton for your page

		Structure

			Fixed Content

# Quick tabs

h1#name = <h1 id="name"></h1> 
h1.name = <h1 class="name"></h1>

# Bootstrap

Building raw from HTML can be very time consuming
its much better to find an amazing template online 

Bootstrap also provides amazing ways to get started quickly on a website.
It provides all code for free and you just drop the code in

1) go to bootstrap.com
2) copy the starter template


# Node JS

Javascript took over the web because Netscape Navigator ivented it, but everyone adopted it.

Today javascript powers most if not all of our browsers 

BUT! Smart people from google took java script out of the browser and made it to run standalone as an application which we now call NodeJS.

NodeJS ==> Just Java script without the browser


# Build a Node Server

When using Node.js we can reference existing libraries.

To install them use the commands in powershell:
		npm install <<library name>>
Global instal (all of windows) add -g

The unse the library with:

	var myVariable = require('<<library-name>>')

ie:	var http = require('http')

# ReactJS

ReactJS builds a VIRTUAL WEB PAGE, then displays it as a REAL WEB PAGE.

React can JUST UPDATE  THE BITS WHICH HAVE CHANGED, MAKING DYNAMIC PAGES FASTER

Manual React Page
