##Technical Review

#QUESTIONS
#Why are you at Sparta?
-To learn first hand the real world uses of a coding environment in a company.

#Strengths?
-Being able to work with a tight deadline

#Weaknesses?
-Need to rest my mind for some minutes every hour and half to increase productivity

#Project work of note?
	University: My undergrad game where I attach a HR Monitor to someone whilst playing the game to see what scares them
	Sparta: Unity Simulation of the office space with textures

#Why do you like coding?
-It allows me to create whatever I want, however I want, to then see it work on a screen and feel pride

#Where do you see yourself in 5 yeasrs?
-Working in the coding field but in a much higher rank, perhaps managing 2 or more projects

#Code out fizzbuzz here in the notepad NOW!
-
```c
for(int i=0; i<100;i++)
{
    if(x %15 ==0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("FizzBuzz");
    }
    else if (x % 3 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Fizz");
    }
    else if (x % 5 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Buzz");
    }
}

#Whats a...

Class: a blueprint for an object
Interface: fully abstract, used by architect to force a class to have a method
Instance: an object 
Sealed Class: class which cannot have derived
Abastract Class: a class with one or more abstract methods
Virtual Keyword: tagging a method to be overwritten in a derived class
Overide keyword: using a base method in an derived class
overload keyword: putting values into the parameters of a method
Scrum 3 pillars:Transparancy, Inspection, Adaptation

OOP 4 Pillars: 
	 inheritance:
	 encapsulation: 
	 polymorphism: inheritance with optional override
	 abstraction:

Agile:
	Flexible and adaptable: work in sprints

	Collaboration over negociation
	People over processes
	Working software over documentation

Scrum: 3 Roles
		Scrum Master: removes blockers on the team
		Product owner: owns backlogs, interacts with client
		Devs 3-9: jointly accountable for the work

		Definition of done

		Backlogs: project backlog: for the project
				  sprint backlog: the backlog for the sprint

Sprint 4 meeting: Plan
				  Daily (yesterday, today, blockers)
				  review(present work done to client)
				  retro (internal review)
		
SDLC: 	feasability, requirements, analysis, design, build, test, release, maintain, document


SOLID: best to have one method only

S ingle responsability: one class one thing
O pen for extension/closed modification
L iskov
I njection one method Only
D ependancy Injection (parent/child interchange)
