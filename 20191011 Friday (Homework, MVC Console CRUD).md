#Class Work and weekend homework:

1. https://pastebin.com/7b6GShfg
	
	Check FUAT/Ali and other code who have completed Northwind CRUD console updating API. Replicate this code for this app, changing where required get it working


	Finish CRUD Update/Delete for TaskItems please - work amongst class for best practice and ideas


2. https://github.com/philanderson888/c-sharp/tree/master/StandaloneProjects/API/API_2019_09_20_Read_API_Data_To_Website

Critical file: https://github.com/philanderson888/c-sharp/blob/master/StandaloneProjects/API/API_2019_09_20_Read_API_Data_To_Website/Controllers/ToDoItemsController.cs

See if you can develop this theme from the console CRUD reading API and move it into the CONTROLLER of MVC APP to also read SAME API.
Note that the actual code should be the same, just in a MVC WEB APP not a CONSOLE APP.
