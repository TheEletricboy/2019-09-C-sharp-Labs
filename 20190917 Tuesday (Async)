##ASync

If we run an application then the code will run top-down, line by line.
If an operation takes a long time then the program will hang and appear to do nothing.
Today we want responsive apps which dont hang unless there is a critical fault.
Examples mainly include online/offline apps which have the sensitivity to the network status.
If the app goes offline, it can weither stop working or revert to an offline mode.

C# 
```c

	Main()
		DThisAsync();		//convention is use word 'ASync' at END OF METHOD
		Console.ReadLine(); //ensure program stops and waits for async to complete. Otherwise application may terminate beforew async returns

	async static void DoThisAsync(){
		await.File.ReadAsync("thisfile.txt"); 	//marks the line where the async opeartion takes place
	}
```
The Async keyword ensure that the Main mehtod does not wait for this method
but the processing just calls the method then continues processing the nest line of the main method.
